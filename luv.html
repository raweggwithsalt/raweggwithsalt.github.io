            We met again after we finished our last semester exam on 10th grade. I was so excited when you told me that you wanted to go out with me before our exam.
            We have been communicating before, but it was all through chats and games. We never truly met face to face, so it feels great that I got the chance to be able to meet you :D.
            When we were hanging out, I realized that my feelings grow stronger. Your kindness, the way you talk, the way you act, and everything that you do, I loved all of it.
            After that day, we got closer and closer, we talk almost everyday, and I take my chance to ask you to go out one more time, so I can confess my feelings to you.

        <font size="25px"> <b> &hearts;One Month!</b> </font> <br>
        <div class="div2"> <br><br>
           And finally we are dating for a month! I thought that maybe I should buy a small present to celebrate this day, so I bought our first son, the bear :D.
           The phase where we still so embarassed to say "I love you" and still embarassed to express love to each other, where we always blush when we are holding hands together, when you still salting gajelas sometimes.... <br>
           This whole one month, we learned so much about each other, about our past, our family, what kind of things that we like and dislike, and the stuffs that we always struggle against. We started to accept each other's flaws and start to help each other out! 
           <br>
           Still, it was a very bucin phase for both of us, but I enjoyed it a lot!

        <div class="div3">
          <img class="img1"  src="assets/anip3.jpg"> <div class="textdiv1">
            Here we are at 3 months! Did our bucin phase reducing slowly? Did we give less affection during these 3 months? Keknya engga deh... <br>
            I remembered that this is probably the most bucin phase that we ever got into, where we would say that we miss each other after only 5 minutes of not chatting, or when I just got home and you texted me that you missed me again :p <br>
            You said that you were anxious too because there are rumours about how couples don't really last for more than 3 months, but we discussed about it together and reassure each other! And look, we are still keeping up right? <br>
            Then, you told me that you wanted to celebrate Christmas together, and take pics under the Christmas tree! I still remember how excited you were when you talk about celebrating Christmas together. <br>
            <--------- and it became your Instagram profile picture.

            February 14th, the day where two lovers give each other presents to express their love and affection, but turns out we stayed with the tradition of girls giving gifts on Valentine's Day and boys giving presents on White Day. <br>
            You kept it as a secret when I asked you about the stuff that you were preparing, and turns out you spoiled about it little by little and eventually told me what did you make :D <br>
            Even so, I was very excited when I received the beautiful crochet flower bouquet you gave me. Even though it's the second bouquet that you gave, it still makes me happy and loved &hearts; &hearts; <br>

            For this one whole year, we have been together for a veryy long time. We spend almost everyday together, seeing each other after school, and spend times chatting about our days. <br>
            Strangely, we have never had a fight ever. Even when sometimes we might annoy each other, but we have never got into such a huge fight. It's alright though, because when we have something we want to talk about, we always communicate to each other about it, and find a solution for the problem, and I love that we did that &hearts;&hearts;&hearts; <br>
            Until now, I have never been bored of your face, your voice, your laugh, and your bright smile &hearts; <br>
            We have gone to places we have never gone to, did fun activities together, spent so much quality time, and knew each other more and more, deeper and deeper. I'm glad that I started to reach you out back then. <br>
            This whole year, I felt so loved by you, from the affections you give, the reassurement, and the comfort you gave. I am truly grateful to be together with you my dear &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;.

            This day is the day that I never expect to actually happen. I thought that any of my best friends won't be in a relationship, so the idea of having a double date seems to be impossible. <br>
            Turns out he did get into a relationship, then we actually had a double date..
